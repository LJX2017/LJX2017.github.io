Hello, I am Kevin Li. I am a second year computer science major at UC Irvine, where I participated in research with Prof. Weining Shen.

In the past, my work and interests have centered around large language model, with a specific focus on Multimodal Systems and Long-context generation. However, I am always eager to broaden my horizons and dive into new areas of computer science and AI that push technological boundaries.
